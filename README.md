# Terrain-Shadow-Shader
A real-time shader that generates casted shadows and shadows from normals in Love2d. Using Lua, height, color, and normal maps are generated based on terrain generated using Perlin noise.  GLSL is used for the shader to use raytracing for cast shadows. Based on the program created in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMTeCqNkId8
